<p class="aboutMe"> Hi! My name is Heather Barton and I am the name behind Flutter Creative. Just like most, I started my college career not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I stumbled around and took several classes. I knew I loved art so always made sure I had an art class each semester. Clarity came to me when my teacher in my 2D class said you should look into graphic design. I decided to take her advice and switched schools. This changed everything for me! It all started to click and when I took the required photography class, I really feel in love. This page is a collection of my forever changing artwork. I hope you enjoy it. Please feel free to reach out to me and let me know what you think.
