How to run my project
1. Go to root directory of project
2. Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
3. Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
4. Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process (I had issues when I tried myself on another computer, after I npm installed and started express didn't download. I had to install express then the project ran fine.)
5. Open browser and go to localhost:3030/
6. My project for the FSJS Code Louisville class is on comments page!
